	   irrelevant). While intuitive ideas in this direction have accompanied analysis from the early days

	   field that in the past few years turned out to be particularly suitable for numerical problems.
	   While Levi-Civita's field appears to be of fundamental importance and simplicity, efforts to
	   introduce advanced concepts of calculus on it are only very new. In this paper, we address several

	   the involved operators. Automatic generation of efficient derivative codes thus requires analysis of
	   programs for detection of such properties and systematic methods for their exploitation in composing
	   the derivative codes. We suggest a hierarchical approach based on a partitioning of the
	   computational or program graph as a means to deduce workable solutions to this hard problem. Each
	   partition corresponds to a localized scope for derivative computation, and hierarchical partitions
	   provide a mechanism for exploiting program structure at various levels. As a particular example, we
	   discuss dynamic programming approaches for finding good one-dimensional partitions and
	   generalizations to arbitrary directed acyclic graphs that, by recycling substructure information,
	   allow one to determine the optimal elimination ordering for a graph with $n$ nodes with complexity
	   $O(2^n)$, as compared with the $O(n!)$ complexity of a naive search. Lastly, we give a concrete

	   using an iterative process to reduce a residual quantity. Straightforward differentiation of these
	   programs yields an iterative recurrence that involves both the derivative of the residual, and the
	   derivative of the original process. For a certain class of these problems, the derivative recurrence
	   can be {\em simplified\/} to avoid computing the derivative of the original process. A

	   differentiation commonly performs this evaluation by associating vector storage either with the
	   program variables (in the case of forward-mode automatic differentiation) or with the adjoint
	   variables (in the case of reverse). Each vector component contains a partial derivative with respect
	   to an independent variable, or a partial derivative of a dependent variable, respectively. The
	   vectors may be full vectors, or they may be dynamically managed sparse data structures. In either
	   case, many of these vectors will be scalar multiples of one another. For example, any intermediate
	   variable produced by a unary operation in the forward mode will have a derivative vector that is a
	   multiple of the derivative for the argument. Any computational graph node that is read just once
	   during its lifetime will have an adjoint vector that is a multiple of the adjoint of the node that
	   reads it. It is frequently wasteful to perform component multiplications explicitly. A scalar
	   multiple of another vector can be replaced by a single multiplicative ``scale factor''
	   together with a pointer to the other vector. Automated use of this ``dirty vector''
	   technique can save considerable memory management overhead and dramatically reduce the number of
	   floating-point operations required. In particular, dirty vectors often allow shared threads of
	   computation to be reverse-accumulated cheaply. The mechanism permits a number of generalizations,

	   chain rule, there is room for different strategies computing the same numerical results but whose
	   computational cost may vary significantly. Several strategies exploiting high-level structure of the
	   underlying computer code are known to reduce computational cost as opposed to blindly applying
	   automatic differentiation. An example includes ``interface contraction'' where one takes
	   advantage of the fact that the number of variables passed between subroutines is small compared with
	   the number of propagated directional derivatives. Unfortunately, these so-called narrow interfaces
	   are not immediately available. This study investigates the use of the VCG graph drawing tool to
	   recognize narrow interfaces in the computational graph, a certain directed acyclic graph used to
	   represent data dependences of variables in the underlying computer code.",

	   proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of
	   the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger

	   storage requirements. This article presents the function {\tt revolve}, which generates

	   representation of the {\em target-space projection\/} of a jet under a particular

	   map\/} of a function to higher orders of contact. Since the tangent map unifies the concepts of
	   derivative, tangent vector, and the tangent linear model into a single geometrical object, the
	   geometrical framework of higher-order differentiation and its natural connections to perturbation
	   theory and to higher-order tangent models become clear. Jets contain additional structure beyond
	   that of DA vectors; in particular, the jet concept meshes nicely with both the
	   ``applicative'' and ``object oriented'' programming paradigms. The jet concept
	   may therefore provide insights to guide new implementations of automatic differentiation. In
	   particular, jets may help to define derivatives of composite objects such as structures; they also

	   way to compute a Jacobian, in particular if it has a comparatively stable sparsity structure. In the
	   more general case where Jacobians are dense or have a changing sparsity structure, the efficiency
	   advantages of AD cannot be fully exploited by the usual approach. Because we actually need only the
	   Newton step, not the Jacobian matrix, we introduce an AD method that generally avoids the
	   accumulation of the Jacobian. To this end we perform not only the known node elimination steps on
	   the computational graph but also arc elimination steps. This can reduce the complexity that is
	   measured by the fill-in and makes the computation of Newton steps more efficient. The outline of the
	   method to be introduced were first proposed by Griewank in 1990. Here we show extensions and certain

	   exact results are obtained using numerical (as opposed to symbolic) manipulation. The key ideas are
	   a hyperpyramid data structure and a generalized Leibniz's rule. Any expression in $n$ variables
	   corresponds to a hyperpyramid array, in $n$-dimensional space, containing the numerical values of
	   all unique partial derivatives (not wasting space on different permutations of derivatives). The
	   arrays for simple expressions are combined by hyperpyramid operators to form the arrays for more
	   complicated expressions. These operators are facilitated by a generalized Leibniz's rule which,
	   given a product of multivariable functions, produces any partial derivative by forming the minimum
	   number of products (between two lower partials) together with a product of binomial coefficients.
	   The algorithms are described in abstract pseudo-code. A section on implementation shows how these
	   ideas can be converted into practical and efficient programs in a typical computing environment. For

	   obtained from applying automatic differentiation in this black-box fashion are free from truncation
	   error and, in this application, their computation requires less time. To increase the efficiency of
	   automatic differentiation further, a technique called interface contraction is used. The idea of
	   interface contraction is to exploit the local structure of a given code by temporarily reducing the
	   number of derivatives propagated through the code. By reporting performance results, we show the

	   complexity for functions given by Kantorovic trees. It is based on approriate representations of the
	   gradient and the Hessian. After a brief exposition of the forward and reverse mode of automatic
	   differentiation for derivatives up to second order and compact proofs of their complexities, the new
	   forward mode is presented and analyzed. It is shown that in the case of functions f: R^n - R with a
	   tree as Kantorovic graph the algorithm is only O(ln(n)) times as expensive as the reverse mode.
	   Except for the fact that the new method is a very efficient implementation of the forward mode, it
	   can be used to significantly reduce the length of characterizing sequences before applying the
	   memory expensive reverse mode. For the Hessian all discussed algorithms are shown to be efficiently
	   parallelizable. Some numerical examples confirm the advantages of the new forward
	   mode."

	   the brain, the mathematical model to localize the electrical activity on the human cortex is given

	   localize the brain activity. Here, the standard approach is to minimize the Euclidean norm of the
	   current distribution of the underlying dipole moments. A generalization from the Euclidean norm to
	   general $p$-norms with~$1 reconstructions appear more focal as~$p$ approaches~$1$. Rather than using
	   reweighted least-squares algorithms with their potential numerical instabilities, a gradient-based
	   optimization algorithm is investigated. More precisely, a Newton-type algorithm is used where the
	   required gradient of the cost function is either accurately computed by automatic differentiation or
	   approximated by finite differences. Numerical results are reported illustrating that accurate
	   gradients computed by the so-called reverse mode of automatic differentiation are more efficient

	   function whose derivatives are sought. In this note, two cases are investigated where the underlying
	   functions are given by the solution of different two-dimensional electrostatic potential problems.
	   For a rectangular region, the function and its derivatives can be derived analytically. For a
	   function based on an L-shaped region, the function is computed by a simulation code and its
	   derivatives are obtained by automatic differentiation. In general, this powerful technique is
	   applicable if a function is given in the form of a computer program in a high-level programming
	   language such as Fortran, C, or C++. In contrast to numerical differentiation providing
	   approximations based on divided differences, the derivatives computed by automatic differentiation
	   are accurate. Furthermore, automatic differentiation is also shown to be computationally

	   widely used in the numerical approximation of flow fields containing moderate to strong shocks.
	   Roe's flux takes as input $10$ variables describing the flow either side of a cell face and
	   returns as output the $5$ variables for the numerical flux. We present results concerning the
	   efficiency of derivative calculations for Roe's flux using several currently available AD

	   methods are developed that assert that the requested derivatives are really those of the solution of
	   the ODE, and not those of the algorithm used to solve the ODE. Next, high-order solvers for DAEs are
	   developed that in a fully automatic way turn an $n$-th order solution step of the DAEs into a
	   corresponding step for an ODE initial value problem. In particular, this requires the automatic
	   high-order solution of implicit relations, which is achieved using an iterative algorithm that
	   converges to the exact result in at most $n+1$ steps. We give examples of the performance of the

	   robustness and effciency of a large number of numerical algorithms. An upcoming new version of the
	   differentiation-enabled NAGWare Fortran 95 compiler is described that uses programming language
	   extensions and a semantic code transformation known as automatic differentiation to provide
	   Jacobians of numerical programs with machine accuracy. We describe a new user interface as well as
	   the relevant algorithmic details. In particular, we focus on the source transformation approach that
	   generates locally optimal gradient code for single assignments by vertex elimination in the
	   linearized computational graph. Extensive tests show the superiority of this method over the current
	   overloading-based approach. The robustness and convenience of the new compiler-feature is
	   illustrated by various case studies."

	abstract = "This paper presents the first extended set of results from EliAD, a
	   source-transformation implementation of the vertex-elimination Automatic Differentiation approach to
	   calculating the Jacobians of functions defined by Fortran code (Griewank and Reese, Automatic
	   Differentiation of Algorithms: Theory, Implementation, and Application, 1991, pp. 126-135). We
	   introduce the necessary theory in terms of well known algorithms of numerical linear algebra applied
	   to the linear, extended Jacobian system that prescribes their relationship between the derivatives
	   of all variables in the function code. Using an example, we highlight the potential for numerical
	   instability in vertex-elimination. We describe the source transformation implementation of our tool
	   EliAD and present results from 5 test cases, 4 of which are taken from the MINPACK-2 collection
	   (Averick et al, Report ANL/MCS-TM-150, 1992) and for which hand-coded Jacobian codes are available.
	   On 5 computer/compiler platforms, we show that the Jacobian code obtained by EliAD is as efficient
	   as hand-coded Jacobian code. It is also between 2 to 20 times more efficient than that produced by
	   current, state of the art, Automatic Differentiation tools even when such tools make use of
	   sophisticated techniques such as sparse Jacobian compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
	   reverse-ordered pre-elimination from the (successively updated) extended Jacobian system of all
	   intermediate variables used once. Thereafter, the monotonic forward/reverse ordered eliminations of
	   all other intermediates is shown to be very efficient. On only one test case were orderings
	   determined by the Markowitz or related VLR heuristics found superior. A re-ordering of the
	   statements of the Jacobian code, with the aim of reducing reads and writes of data from cache to
	   registers, was found to have mixed effects but could be very beneficial.",

	   Automatic dierentiation avoids the truncation errors characteristic of divided dierence
	   approximations. However, the derivative code produced by automatic dierentiation can be signicantly
	   less ecient than one produced by hand. This shortcoming may be overcome by utilizing insight into
	   the high-level structure of a computation. This paper focuses on how to take advantage of the fact
	   that the number of variables passed between subroutines frequently is small compared with the number
	   of variables with respect to which one wishes to dierentiate. Such an interface contraction, coupled
	   with the associativity of the chain rule for differentiation, allows one to apply automatic
	   differentiation in a more judicious fashion, resulting in much more ecient code for the computation
	   of derivatives. A case study involving the ADIFOR (Automatic Dierentiation of Fortran) tool and a

	   epidemiology is examined, and performance figures are presented."

	   evaluate an alternative strategy that first carries out the spin-up, then evaluates the full

	   sensitivities of the cyclo-stationary state. We demonstrate the benefit of the strategy for the

	   complicated geometry. To deal with this, registration methods often rely on a transformation model
	   consisting of a dense regular grid such as a free form deformation or B-spline grid. However, very
	   dense grids or meshes are usually needed to register images with convoluted shapes, and a regular
	   mesh structure is not well suited for the irregular structure of the brain. What is therefore needed
	   is a meshfree approach such as a radial basis function transformation model. Unfortunately, because
	   radial basis functions are typically non-compact, using them with large numbers of points is fraught
	   with numerical difficulties and, as a result, their use in image registration is not prevalent. The
	   goal of this work is to overcome these computational difficulties so that radial basis function
	   transformations can be used efficiently, even with large numbers of points. To achieve this, a new
	   registration framework was developed based on automatic differentiation and the fast multipole
	   method. Automatic differentiation is useful since an important component of registration is
	   computing the gradient of the similarity metric which is to be optimized. Automatic differentiation
	   allows one to efficiently calculate gradients without having to write any gradient code explicitly.
	   Although the technique of automatic differentiation is well established, it does not appear to be
	   used for image registration. The fast multipole method was developed to efficiently evaluate large
	   sums such as radial basis functions but its use in image registration is still minimal. With the
	   integration of these algorithms within a complete registration framework, it should be possible to
	   obtain a truly meshfree registration."

	   processes. Such models are approximations to the real phenomena because the physical conditions are
	   simplified or because the values of the parameters intervening in the modeling are known only
	   approximately. For this reason, an obligatory step in the application of these models is the
	   assessment of their sensitivity to changes in the parameters. Sensitivity analysis is also required
	   to evaluate the influence of the different input variables in the outcome of the model. In general
	   this analysis is carried out by repeated computation of the model to different sets of input
	   variables and settings of the model. A more fruitful procedure to carry out such analysis can be
	   achieved by automatic differentiation. In this paper we illustrate such approach through its
	   application to the model of an eruptive plinian column. The results of the analysis allow to assess,

	   ultimately column height, by changes in their boundary value (i.e. at the vent). The effect of
	   changes in the value of the gas constants, density of pyroclasts and specific heat of the erupted

	   values of the variables for different set of boundary values without recurring to new runs of the

	   Odyss\'ee offers both the forward and the reverse differentiation modes, that produce the

	   Following a presentation of the methods and tools and of their relative advantages and drawbacks,
	   the performances of the codes produced by the manual and automatic methods are compared, in terms of
	   accuracy and of computing efficiency (CPU and memory needs). The perturbation method
	   (finite-difference approximation of derivatives) is also used as a reference. Based on the test of
	   Taylor, the accuracy of the two AD modes proves to be excellent and as high as machine precision

	   likely due to the fact that a theoretical model (state equations) and a practical model (computer

	   The MD code largely outperforms all other methods in computing efficiency, a subject of current

	   preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F
	   uses components provided by the OpenAD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of
	   the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results
	   implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation
	   engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation
	   algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences
	   of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes,
	   OpenAD/F supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine
	   level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet
	   simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute
	   sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such
	   as bottom topography as independent (control) variables."

	   In this paper, a systematic approach for the identification of a suitable transport model (structure

	   equations is presented. For this transport coefficient two different model structures are proposed.
	   An investigation of parameter identifiability based on local sensitivity analysis is carried out for
	   both model structures prior to model identification. It is shown that the number of model parameters
	   can be significantly reduced by targeted selection of the identifiable parameter subsets. This
	   facilitates to reduce the overall computational effort. After setting up the best identifiable
	   parameter sets for each model structure, a nonlinear, constrained least-squares parameter estimation
	   problem is stated and solved using standard solution methods. Automatic differentiation techniques

	   estimating the parameters (observation error). Therefore, to estimate the temporal variation in the
	   population process, it is important to separate these two errors. Traditional random effect models
	   can be used to separate the two errors. However, it is difficult to implement the required
	   simultaneous maximization and integration for dynamic nonlinear non-Gaussian models. An alternative

	   approximation and importance sampling, and MCMC to implement Bayesian analysis. To demonstrate ADMB

	   the characteristics of ancient eruptions are among the purposes of these models that require a
	   better knowledge of the characteristics and properties of this function. The first part of the study
	   shows that the three usual shapes chosen for this function yield apparently the same behaviour of

	   remaining two functions is viewed as dependent on the boundary conditions and specified with respect
	   to them. A calibration of the entrainment function with respect to real data is achieved through a
	   power law established between column height and discharge, the latter being related to velocity,
	   radius and bulk density at the vent. According to a discussion on eruptive data, the construction of
	   a mathematical parametrization for epsilon, with respect to boundary conditions and the heights of
	   the vent and the tropopause, appears to be an unwarranted and difficult task since any new addition
	   to the observed data will definitely modify the power law. A 4-D database covering the range of
	   boundary conditions usually found in Plinian eruptions, together with an interpolation operator, are
	   constructed in order to provide an approximated parameter for any set of boundary conditions in the

	   &#8211; Indeed, analytical modeling is well suited regarding optimization procedure, but the
	   modeling of complex devices needs sometimes numerical formulations. This paper then reviews the
	   concepts implemented in CADES which aim to manage the interactions of analytical and numerical

	   large and complex numerical code computing multidimensional integrals of functions. Thus, the paper
